# News App

This is a news application made from a tutorial by GreatStack! Uses vite, bootstrap and react!

# Installation

It uses a .env file with a news.api api key in the format:

VITE_API_KEY= /

Then run `npm install` and start up the website using `npm run dev`

## Results
`The deployment doesn't quite work at the moment!` Your localhost should look like this:
(There are no images or description provided due to the api, not the web app!)
The headlines are changing, if you haven't noticed! üòÅ Also this is Australian news, you can go ahead and change this by changing the url string in NewsBoard.jsx `?country=au` to your country.
